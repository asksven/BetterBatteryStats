# Building BetterBatteryStats

BetterBatteryStats builds with `ant`
To build it requires dependent projects (libraries) to be built with ant as
well:

* ActionbarSherlock
* AndroidCommon

If dependent build.xml files are missing they can be create with

    android update project --path .
(see "[using ant to automate building android][using-ant-to-automate-building-android]" for more
